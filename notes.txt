Time to try implementing something based on thousand brains.

1) each weak learner should have different though possibly overlapping information similar to RandomForest
2) there should be sparse coupling between learners
3) coupling should be recurrent

Initialize K trees
Initialize K random vectors theta_i
Connect each tree to all other trees with probability p

For tree in forest
    append 0s to X, one for each connected tree

For i = 1:T
    for tree in forest
        tree.fit(X,y,theta)
    for tree in forest
        X[tail] =  outputs of adjacent
